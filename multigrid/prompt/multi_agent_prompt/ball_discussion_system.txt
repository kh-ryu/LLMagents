 [Wall, ^, Empty]]
Adjacent Grid Description:
To your left is wall
In front of you is ball
To your right is empty

Response:
Thought: From my perspective, there is a ball directly in front of me and there is a door behind the ball. For my teammate to open the door, I have to remove the ball blocking this door. Meanwhile, my teammate can focus on finding the key.
